                One of his most effective tools was connecting clients to peers
                who have experience or skills in an area critical to the client
                at that moment. But some clients were reluctant to talk with
                another leader, even though they understood the benefits,
                because they did not want to reveal themselves to someone in
                their area, expose what they were working on, or tell someone
                else what the issue was.

                LeaderBridge is the online version of these personal
                introductions, with a twist â€“ the parties can remain anonymous,
                so there are no risks.
